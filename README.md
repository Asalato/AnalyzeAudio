# AnalyzeAudio
Frequency Analyzer made with .Net Core.  
Work as Console Application.

Calculate frequency spectrum using FFT, so accuracy maybe bad.  
changing parameter of "SampleingRate" or "BufferSize" expect accuracy improvement.

This project deeply inspired by [Realtime Microphone FFT with ScottPlot](https://github.com/swharden/Csharp-Data-Visualization/tree/master/projects/18-09-19_microphone_FFT_revisited).
